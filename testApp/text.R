anticipatedCaseDesc <- "Reported number of cases on a particular event day may not be finalized because there can be significant delay between 
sample collection and case confirmation: some may obtain their confirmed results as late as 14 days or more after sample collection. 
We create a predictive model ('nowcasting model') that anticipated how many more positive cases could have their sample collected on a particular
event date but has yet to be confirmed, based on past reporting trend and current numbers of reported cases. Anticipated numbers come with uncertainty,
the 95% prediction interval, and is represented in the plot by the error bar."
